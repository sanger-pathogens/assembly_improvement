package Bio::AssemblyImprovement::Assemble::SGA::IndexAndCorrectReads;

# ABSTRACT: Performs SGA error correction on the reads 

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Runs SGA index and correct. Results file (by default called _sga_error_corrected.fastq) and intermediate files
placed in a temporary directory. This temporary directory is cleaned up when this object goes out of scope.
Any script/module wishing to use the results should copy them into a more permanent location.

   use Bio::AssemblyImprovement::Assemble::SGA::IndexAndCorrectReads;

   my $sga_error_corrector = Bio::AssemblyImprovement::Assemble::SGA::IndexAndCorrectReads->new(
      input_filename => 'my_sga_preprocessed_data.fastq',
      algorithm      => 'ropebwt',
      threads        => 8,
      kmer_length	 => 41,
      sga_exec	     => '/path/to/sga/script.pl',
   );

   $sga_error_corrector->run();
   my $results_file = $sga_corrector->_output_filename();
   
=method run

Run the SGA index and correct commands with the appropriate parameters.

=method _output_filename

Return the full path to the results file
